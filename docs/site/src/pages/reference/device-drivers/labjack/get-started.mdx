directly connect to your LabJack T-series devices. This page will walk you through some
of the important prerequisites necessary to get started with the LabJack driver.

## Installation

The LabJack driver comes installed with every Synnax deployment.

### Installing LJM

The LabJack LJM library must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your LabJack
hardware. Instructions for installing LJM software can be found on the [LabJack
website.](<https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit#LJMSoftwareInstallerDownloads-T4,T7,T8,Digit-Windows(x86_64)LJMSoftwareInstallerDownloads>)

<Note.Note variant="warning">
  If you have a Synnax cluster already running before installing LJM, you'll need to
  restart the cluster for Synnax to recognize the LJM installation.
</Note.Note>

## OS Compatibility

The LabJack driver is only compatible when running the Synnax Database on a **Windows**
machine. The driver will not be able to find your devices when running on Linux, macOS,
or within a Docker container (even if that container is running on Windows).
